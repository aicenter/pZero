# Recursive Representation Implementation Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ **Issue 1: Exploding Gradients** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Gradient norms were ~333 (way too high)
**Root Causes**:
- Poor weight initialization in RecursiveRepresentationNetwork
- Excessive activation scaling (tanh * 2.0)
- No gradient clipping for recursive components

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Better Weight Initialization**: Added Xavier initialization with reduced gain (0.5)
2. **Balanced Activation Scaling**: Changed from `tanh * 2.0` → `tanh * 1.0`
3. **Gradient Clipping**: Added specific clipping for recursive network (max_norm=2.0)
4. **Learning Rate Adjustment**: Reduced initially, then increased as gradients stabilized

### ✅ **Issue 2: Training Data Flow** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Training loop was using dynamics network instead of recursive representation
**Solution**: Modified `_process_recursive_representation_sequence()` to use `observation_inference()`

### ✅ **Issue 3: Poor Initialization** (FIXED)
**Problem**: Zero initialization and large parameter initialization
**Solutions**:
1. Changed `last_linear_layer_init_zero=False` for recursive components
2. Added custom weight initialization with reduced gain
3. Initialize initial latent state with small random values instead of zeros

## Current Architecture

### RecursiveRepresentationNetwork
```python
Input: [observation, previous_latent_state] → Concat → MLP → tanh * 1.0 → new_latent_state
```

### Training Flow
1. **Initial Step**: `initial_inference(obs[0])` → latent_state[0]
2. **Subsequent Steps**: `observation_inference(obs[t], latent_state[t-1])` → latent_state[t]
3. **Loss Calculation**: Standard MuZero losses applied to latent sequence

### Key Hyperparameters
- **Learning Rate**: 0.001 (increased from 0.0005 after gradient stabilization)
- **Gradient Clipping**: 2.0 for recursive network, 2.0 for overall model
- **Recursive Hidden Channels**: 256
- **Recursive Layers**: 2
- **Activation Scaling**: tanh * 1.0

## Remaining Considerations

### Data Sampling
- **Episode-based sampling** is configured but may need verification
- Need to ensure observation sequences are properly passed to training

### Monitoring
- Added debug prints for observation batch shapes
- Added gradient monitoring for recursive components
- Added latent state statistics logging

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Run Updated Diagnostic**: Test with new gradient clipping and learning rate
2. **Monitor Training**: Check if loss decreases more significantly (target >5% improvement)
3. **Verify Real Training**: Test with actual MiniGrid environment
4. **Fine-tune if Needed**: Adjust hyperparameters based on results

## Expected Results
- **Gradient Norms**: Should be in range 0.1-2.0 (previously fixed at ~0.3)
- **Loss Decrease**: Should see >5% improvement over training
- **Latent State Changes**: Should remain active (~7-8 as currently observed)
- **Learning**: Should see meaningful policy/value improvements in real environment
